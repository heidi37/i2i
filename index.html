      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Hi! I'm Amanda.</strong>  On May 5th, 2012 I took the leap and started my business thinking, “why
        not now, and why not me?”Sounds simple right? Sometimes it was,
        sometimes, not so much. However, it has been one of the most gratifying
        decisions I've ever made!
      </p>

      <p>
        I celebrate our community, the relationships we've built, the trust
        we've created and bonds we've nourished and the ways we've given back to
        the communities we live in. I celebrate you, the people who invite me
        into their homes to help in the various ways we do!
      </p>

      <p>
        I celebrate each human that I've collaborated with, who has invested
        their time, used their skills/talents and has been dedicated to the
        mission and vision, while serving our community. You've had an immense
        impact, thank you!
      </p>

      <h2>Our Journey</h2>

      <p>
        We've felt the renewal of springs, growth of summers, changes of autumns
        and the coziness that winters can bring.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        We've laughed and cried together navigating the twists and turns of
        life.
      </p>

      <p>
        We've provided support to elders in their homes as they age in place,
        using a holistic approach.
      </p>

      <p>
        We've experienced some of life's joys by keeping traditions alive by
        setting up and serving at dinner parties with friends and family.
      </p>

      <p>We've experienced sorrows and sat vigil with those we love.</p>

      <p>We've welcomed new life into our hearts and homes.</p>

        <img src="./images/amanda-cat.jpg" class="img-9" alt="Amanda hanging out with a client's cat" />
      </div>

      <p>We've played with cats and chased dogs.</p>

      <p>
        We've experienced illnesses, surgeries and recoveries that required home
        modifications and adapting our environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        We've accompanied each other on adventures near and far, offering
        support along their journey to explore new places or visit family and
        friends. We've gotten creemes and attended local events.

      </div>
      <p>
        We've tended outer and inner gardens, nourishing what comes to flourish.
      </p>

      <p>
        We've installed grab bars so that people can safely navigate their home;
        showering or stairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        We've fixed things that had broken, torn things down that no longer fit,
        and built what was needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        We've recognized Independence means something different to many of us,
        And Inspiration can come from unusual places.
      </p>

      <p>
        Certainly these recent years have brought us challenges and victories,
        together we've navigated what has come, and I'm so grateful to have been
        present for those moments. We've gotten vaccinated and boosted while we
        kept our distance yet stayed close.

      <p>
        I look forward to experiencing the growth and evolution of Inspiration
        to Independence with you!
